        The website was born from a personal desire to explore and connect more deeply with my own cultural roots. It’s designed to offer a similar experience for those who wish to learn more about Chinese holidays while enjoying an interactive, fun experience complete with recipes to try at home.

        Inspired by MÁLÀ PROJECT in NYC, a Sichuanese restaurant founded by four friends, [PROJECT NAME] combines vivid colors, subtle animations, and musical undertones to evoke a homely, nostalgic atmosphere reminiscent of Wong Kar Wai’s iconic storytelling aesthetic—capturing the warmth and beauty of tradition in a modern, digital space.

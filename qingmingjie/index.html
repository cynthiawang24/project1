        　　According to legend, during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Periods, in order to let her son Xi Qi succeed the throne, Li Ji, the consort of Duke Xian of Jin, set up a poisonous scheme to murder the crown prince Shen Sheng, who was forced to commit suicide. Shen Sheng's younger brother, Chong Er, went into exile to avoid the disaster. While in exile, Chong Er suffered a lot of humiliation. Most of the ministers who followed him went their own way one after another. There were only a few loyal men left who followed him all the way. One of them was called Jie Zi Tui (介子推). Once, Chong Er passed out from hunger. In order to save Chong Er, Jie Zi Pui cut off a piece of meat from his own leg, cooked it over a fire and gave it to Chong Er to eat. Nineteen years later, Chong Er returned to his country and became the ruler, Duke Wen of Jin, one of the famous Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn Period.

        　　When Duke Wen of Jin came to power, he rewarded all those who had shared his sufferings with him, but he forgot about Jie Zi Tui. Some people complained for Jie Zi Tui in front of Duke Wen of Jin. Duke Wen of Jin suddenly remembered the old story, his heart is guilty, immediately sent people to invite Jie Zi push to the court to receive the reward and title. However, after several trips, Jie Zi Tui did not come. Duke Wen of Jin had to go in person to invite. However, when Duke Wen came to Jie Zi Tui's house, he saw that the door was closed. Jie Zi Tui didn't want to see him, and had already carried his mother to hide in Mianshan Mountain (southeast of present-day Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province). The Duke of Jin then sent his imperial army up to Mianshan to search for him, but they did not find him. So, someone came up with an idea, saying that it would be better to set fire to the mountain, lighting fires on three sides and leaving one side behind, so that when the fire started, Jie Zi Tui would come out on his own. Duke Wen of Jin ordered the fire to burn the mountain, but the fire burned for three days and three nights, after the fire was extinguished, did not see Kai Zi push out. Up the mountain to see, jiezi push mother and son holding a big charred willow tree has died. Duke Wen of Jin looked at the body of the mesquite push to cry and worship for a while, and then buried the remains, and found that the mesquite push spine blocked a willow tree hole, the hole seems to have something. Pulled out a look, turned out to be a piece of lapel, above the inscription of a poem in blood:
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        　　I cut my flesh to serve you with all my heart, but I hope that my lord will always be clear.
      </p>

      <p>
        　　I will never be seen as a ghost under the willow, but I am better than accompanying the king as an advisor.
      </p>

      <p>
        　　If you have me in your heart, you should always think about yourself when you remember me.
      </p>

      <p>
        　　I am not ashamed in the nine springs, and I will be diligent and clear in my administration.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>
        　　Duke Wen of Jin hid the bloody letter in his sleeve. Then he buried Jie Zi Tui and his mother under the charred willow tree. To commemorate Jie Zi Tui, Duke Wen of Jin ordered to change Mian Shan to “Jie Shan”, built a shrine on the mountain, and designated the day of setting fire to the mountain as the Cold Food Festival, telling the whole country that fireworks were forbidden on this day every year, and only cold food was eaten.
      </p>

        　　When he left, he cut a piece of burnt willow wood and made a pair of wooden clogs in the palace, looking at them every day and sighing, “Woe is the foot.” “It is said to be the origin of the ancient term of respect from subordinates to superiors or from peers to peers.  
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>
        　　The next year, the Duke of Jin led his ministers to pay homage on foot to the grave in plain clothes. When they arrived at the grave, they saw the old willow tree come back to life, with thousands of green branches dancing in the wind. Duke Wen of Jin looked at the resurrected old willow tree and saw it as if he had seen Jie Zi Tui. He went to it respectfully, pinched a branch and wove a circle on his head. After the cleaning, Duke Wen of Jin gave the name of the resurrected old willow tree as “Qingming Willow”, and designated this day as Qingming Festival.
      </p>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>
        　　Afterwards, Duke Wen of Jin often put the book of blood on his side, as a motto to spur himself to rule. He was diligent and clear, and tried his best to govern the country well.
      </p>

        　　After that, the people of Jin were able to live in peace and work happily, and they missed Jie Zi Tui very much. On the day of his death, people banned fireworks to commemorate him. Also with flour and jujube clay, kneaded into the swallow, with willow string up, inserted in the door, to summon his soul, this thing is called “the push of the swallow” (jiezitui also known as jiezhitui). Since then, the cold food and Qingming became the grand festivals of the people all over the country. Whenever cold food is served, people do not make fire to cook and only eat cold food. In the north, the people only eat pre-made cold food such as jujube cake, wheat cake, etc.; in the south, it is mostly green dumplings and glutinous rice candy root. Every Qingming, people weave willow into a circle to wear on the head, the willow branches inserted in front of the house, in order to show remembrance.
